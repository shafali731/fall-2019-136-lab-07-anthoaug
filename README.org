* Daedalus specific instructions (changes from main spec):

This lab is starting with a mostly empty repository (only doctest. is
present). 

You will have to create the *Makefile* and decide on what *.cpp* and
*.h* files you will need. 

You will need at least two targets in your *Makefile* - *main* which
will build the main program and *tests* which will build the
tests. Use the previous labs files as a guide.

For this lab, you will have to decide on a single function as an entry
point and it should return a string representing the correctly
formatted program. You will also have to decide what that function
takes as a parameter or parameters (for example, a filename or a
string representing the unformatted program) but remember that when
the tests are run, there should be no user input - everything should
be automated (you can require user input when the *main* target is run.

Also remember you can embed "\n" in a string for a newline and "\t" for a
tab and that you can compare strings to see if they are the same.
